# BIG_INT_LIBRARY

**Big Integer Arithmetic in C++**

This project implements a custom BigInt class in C++ to handle large integer arithmetic efficiently. It includes various operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and comparison, as well as advanced algorithms like Karatsuba multiplication. The project is optimized for competitive programming scenarios.

**Features**

**Custom BigInt Class:** A robust implementation of a class to handle operations on arbitrarily large integers.

**Efficient Algorithms:** Utilizes the Karatsuba algorithm for fast multiplication of large numbers.

**Modular Arithmetic:** Supports operations like exponentiation with modulo, essential for many computational problems.

**Competitive Programming Ready:** Includes optimizations for fast input/output and preprocessor directives to switch between local and online judge environments.


**Prerequisites**
1. C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
2. A development environment (e.g., VS Code, Code::Blocks) or an online judge platform.

**Detailed Explanation**
*BigInt Class*: The `Int` class is designed to handle integers that exceed the limits of standard data types.

*Karatsuba Multiplication*: This algorithm is used for faster multiplication of large numbers, improving efficiency over traditional methods.

*Modular Exponentiation*: The project includes modular arithmetic functions, which are critical in fields like cryptography.
